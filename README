pb - A simple progress bar

Usage:
$ pb inputfd target

inputfd is defined as a file(usually a processes fd) that will periodically output
the progress status on stdout. This is compared to the target value and displayed.

The character 'q' can be pressed while the program is open to exit prematurely.

Example:
$ pb <(
    echo 10
    sleep 1
    echo 20
    sleep 1
    echo 40
    sleep 1
    echo 50
) 50
